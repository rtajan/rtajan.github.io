I am a researcher specializing in cutting-edge topics within the field of coding theory and communication systems. My reserach interests include Polar Codes, Faster-Than-Nyquist signaling, and open-source developments of software solutions dedicated to digital communications.

In the realm of coding theory, I have delved into the groundbreaking concept of Polar codes. My research not only deepens our understanding of this family of codes but also translates theoretical insights into practical applications, allowing more efficient pre-transformed Polar codes design.

My exploration of Faster-than-Nyquist signaling has led to the development of Expectation Propagation based techniques aimed at pushing the boundaries of data transmission rates close to theoretical limits.

Last but not least, I am part of the [AFF3CT](https://aff3ct.github.io) project. AFF3CT is a C++ open-source library (MIT license) dedicated to the Forward Error Correction simulation.
