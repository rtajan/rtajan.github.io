Since september 2014, I have an associate professor position at [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://www.bordeaux-inp.fr/en) and in the Signal and Image group of the [IMS Laboratory](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr) in Bordeaux, France.

From January 2014 to august 2014, I had a post-doctoral fellow position at CNES in Toulouse under the supervision of Charly Poulliat, Marie-Laure Boucheret, and Guy Lesthievent.

I defended my Ph.D. Thesis in december 2013 at the University of Cergy-Pontoise. I was part of the ICI research group of the ETIS laboratory.
